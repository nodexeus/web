## API Usage Examples

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
const performanceMonitor = usePerformanceMonitor();

// Time a synchronous operation
const result = performanceMonitor.timeOperation('filterUpdate', () => {
    return processFilters(filters);
});

// Time an asynchronous operation
const apiResult = await performanceMonitor.timeAsyncOperation(
    'apiCall',
    async () => {
        return await fetchData();
    },
);

// Get performance metrics
const metrics = performanceMonitor.getMetrics();
const avgDuration = performanceMonitor.getAverageDuration('filterUpdate');
```

### Enhanced Debouncing

```typescript
const debouncedFunction = useEnhancedDebounce(
    async (data) => await processData(data),
    300,
    {
        leading: false,
        trailing: true,
        maxWait: 1000, // Prevent indefinite delays
    },
);

// Use the debounced function
debouncedFunction(data);

// Check if pending
if (debouncedFunction.pending()) {
    console.log('Operation is pending...');
}

// Force immediate execution
await debouncedFunction.flush();
```

### Memoized Functions

```typescript
const memoizedProcessor = useMemoizedCallback(
    (data) => expensiveProcessing(data),
    [dependencies],
    {
        maxSize: 50,
        ttl: 30000, // 30 seconds
    },
);

// Use memoized function
const result = memoizedProcessor(data);

// Check cache status
console.log('Cache size:', memoizedProcessor.size());
console.log('Has cached result:', memoizedProcessor.has(key));
```
